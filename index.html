                <p>I am an enthusiastic Computer Science graduate with a concentration in Networks and Security from Colorado State University. During my time at Colorado State University, I completed a Business Administration minor and earned a certification in entrepreneurship. I bring a comprehensive blend of academic knowledge, technical proficiency, and practical experience in cybersecurity. My background includes hands-on cybersecurity research as well as teaching cyber operations to high school students at MIT. Outside of classes, I have built a solid foundation with numerous certifications, including CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, and three Microsoft Office certifications. In addition to my formal education, I have undertaken various projects that have allowed me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios. These projects include developing secure network infrastructures, performing penetration tests, and conducting vulnerability assessments. My work has not only honed my technical abilities but also enhanced my problem-solving skills and attention to detail. I am passionate about staying updated with the latest trends and technologies in cybersecurity. I regularly participate in workshops, webinars, and conferences to continuously expand my knowledge. My commitment to lifelong learning ensures that I am always equipped with the most current and effective tools and techniques. Beyond my professional pursuits, I am very outgoing and love to be outdoors. I enjoy activities such as boating, skiing, hiking, and wakeboarding. These experiences not only keep me active but also fuel my passion for adventure and learning new skills. I believe that a well-rounded life contributes to a well-rounded professional, and I strive to bring that balance to everything I do. I am now seeking a challenging role where I can leverage my skills and continue to grow my abilities. I am eager to contribute to a dynamic team and make a meaningful impact in the field of cybersecurity.</p>
